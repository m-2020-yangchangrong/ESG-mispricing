`Abstract` : We examine the mispricing of ESG in the Chinese stock market. Our model features the link 
of investors heterogeneity to the persistence of the overnight and intraday components of returns. The 
empirical results present that ESG score has a negative effect on the expected stock overnight returns in 
Fama-MacBeth regression. Consistently, given that the biggest market capitalization and the least 
illiquidity subsamples, the trading strategies by going long (short) the top (bottom) ESG quintile would 
yield negative profits. These conclusions parallel PÃ¡stor et al. (2021a) who provide evidence of green 
stocks have lower expected returns because ESG investors value sustainability.

## Code

All provided code has been tested with 3.9.7 and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Main analysis

We provide two Jupyter notebooks:

- `Main Analysis.ipynb`: Contains the code to replicate all tables of the paper.

## Data

This study employs several datasets:
1. Bloomberg for ESG socre (e.g., ESG score, E score, S score, G score).
2. CSMAR for Fama-French five factors (e.g., mkt_rf, smb, hml, rmw, cma).
3. CSMAR for daily stock observations (e.g., price, turnover).

### Stock sample

The file `fivefactor_yearly` contains the Fama-French five factors used in this study, with the following columns:
- `mkt_rf`: market factor.
- `smb`: size factor.
- `hml`: book-to-market ratio factor.
- `rmw`: profitability factor.
- `cma`: investment factor.
- `rf`: risk-free rate.

The file `yearly_indicator` contains the sample of stocks used in this study, with the following columns:
- `Stkcd`: stock code.
- `Trdyear`: date.
- `overnight_return`: overnight return for each stock i of each year t by accumulating corresponding daily overnight return.
- `size`: market capitalization.
- `BM`: book-to-market ratio.
- `ILLIQ`: Amihud (2002) illiquidity.
- `turnover`: yearly turnover.
- `ESG_score`:  environmental, social, governance score.
- `E_score`: environmental score.
- `S_score`: social score.
- `G_score`: governance score.

The data is provided in single formats:
- Comma-separated values (CSV)
